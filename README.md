# my-beginner-projects
My first programming projects as a beginner

Projects info by time of creation:

* HACKROM

  In the times I were a old school gamer kid, I discovered the word
  "Hackroms", and I wanted to make my own hackroms for lots of
  old games and make them weird. I only have made a hackrom for
  Super Mario Bros (NES) where the game is full of curse words.
  In the folder there is all the romhacking material, I think
  it's better to save them too, because it's hard to find them.
  
* PYTHON/PANDORA

  I think this is my first Python application ever, it's a simple
  terminal program where the user input commands to get answers,
  kinda like a assistant.
  
* CALCULATOR

  One of my first GUI applications I have made in Python is a
  calculator made in tkinter, you can personalize it whoever
  you want and it saves some data about color scheme and language.
  
* NOTEPAD

  In paralel with the calculator, I've made a Notepad in tkinter too.
  It does have color schemes, language options and I triyed to make
  it edit RTF files and have multiple tabs.
  
* MUSIC PLAYER

  The first time ever I've made anything with pygame, it's a simple
  music player made in tkinter, but it can filter the playlist
  by album, artist, gender etc.
  
* PYTHON/JOGO DA VELHA

  It's a simple Tic Tac Toe game made on tkinter, I am very
  proud of it, but it have some bugs.
  
* PYTHON/JOGO DA FORCA

  It's a simple hangman game, but I never finished it because
  I was working on the calculator and the notepad.
  
* PYTHON/NIGHT OWL

  I tryied to make a simple web browser.
  
* PYTHON/EMAIL
  
  I also tryied to make a simple email client.
  
* PYTHON/TABELA PERIÃ“DICA
  
  It's basically the periodic table ( or what it was designed to be ).

* BASIC

  I already knew how to code in Python, so I just wanted to learn
  BASIC for curiosity, in the time I was messing around with Mike OS,
  and I wanted to make small apps in the OS, but I never knew how
  to do it. I've made a simple test for beatlemaniacs and a
  simple calculator.
  
* TRIVIA

  It's a simple quiz game for terminal, I've made this one in my
  android cellphone.
  
* PYTHON/RIMAS
  I was learning to make kivy applications at the time, you
  input a simple word and the app finds the words that better
  ryhme with it.
  
* PASSWORD

  It's a simple password manager, it generates random passwords and
  save them in a .db file.
  
* IDEAPAD
  
  It's a kivy application to write simple notes, I tryied to make
  a build for android and make it sync with dropbox, but I never
  could do it...maybe someday I will try it again.
  
* PYTHON/HOMEWORK

  I've made this one on my android cellphone, it's a simple
  calculator on terminal, but I wanted to make it solve
  geometry and function graphics too.

* PYTHON/GRAMATICAL
  I've this on my phone too, I am really proud of this one,
  the user input a word and the program gets every sintax
  property of it, like the number of letters, vowels, 
  consonants, syllables etc.
  
* PYTHON/METEORO BOT

  I tryied to make a Twitter bot where it posts the closest meteors
  and the distance, time and date informations. It's like a joke,
  to keep people informed about a meteor that maybe will colide
  with earth and destroy everything.
  
* PYTHON/PROJECT
  I wasn't coding python for some months, so I've made this simple
  terminal program in my cellphone to keep my Python skills.
  
* PYTHON/CRIME
  
  It's a terminal game based on Carmem Sandiego, and I even showed
  this one to my highschool friends (I wasn't used to show my scripts to anyone)
  
* PYTHON/PARTY

  One that looks very alike the one before, it's a quiz game with
  a board.
